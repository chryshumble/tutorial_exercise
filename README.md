## A practical approach to git and github

>here, we have learnt how to create files in our local repository, open an empty repository, then push the files from our local repository to github.
### These steps can be followed to push,and retireve files from github

* to push a file:
    * open the file on your local computer
    * initialise git using **git init** _syntax_
    * add the file(s) using **git add 'filename'** _syntax_
    * commit the file(s) using **git commit -m 'commit message'** _syntax_
    * go to your github account and a create an empty repository
    * push the file(s) using the **git push origin main 'ssh or https link'** _syntax_
    * tada! you are good to go.

* to retrieve a file from github:
    * first of all, fork the repository
    * then clone the repository to your local computer
    * then clone the upstream branch.
